# Project: HyperJob Agency
### About
Web services are useful to share information almost instantly. You publish a resume, and in five minutes an employer is inviting you to the interview. Moreover, there are many employees and employers are meeting each other at the same place. With the help of Django, you'll create this application for the HyperJob agency.
### Learning outcomes
You will learn how to create a dynamic web site with Django. You will practice your skills in creating content in the database and serving the data through HTTP. To make pages adaptive, you create templates instead of simple HTML pages. After completing this project, you will be able to create another client-server application by yourself.
